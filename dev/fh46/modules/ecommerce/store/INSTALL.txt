Name: Store module
Author: Matt Westgate <drupal at asitis dot org>
********************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

1. Place the entire store directory into your Drupal modules/store/ 
   directory. 
   
2. If you plan on using the whole ecommerce system of Drupal, you can 
   load the database definition file for all the ecommerce modules 
   using the tool of your choice (e.g. phpmyadmin). For mysql and 
   command line access use:
   
     mysql -u user -p drupal < store.mysql
   
   Replace user with the MySQL username, and drupal with the table 
   being used.
   
   Database definitions for any modules that are not part of the core 
   ecommerce module need to be installed separately. See the INSTALL.txt
   for any contributed modules you plan on using. These modules are
   located in the ecommerce/contrib directory.
   
3. Enable this module by navigating to:
       
     administer > configuration > modules
     
4. Grant the proper access to user accounts under:

    administer > accounts > permissions

5.  Check what other modules should be installed under:
    
    administer > configuration > modules > store
