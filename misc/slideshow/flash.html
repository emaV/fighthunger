<h2>Support WFP</h2>
Feed an entire classroom. For an average of just 19 cents per day, or US$34 annually, you can feed a child in school for one year. When food is offered at school, enrollment and attendance increase and a student's ability to learn improves. <br />
<br />
As the largest humanitarian organization in the world, WFP provides food aid to an average of 90 million people, including 56 million hungry children, in more than 80 countries—the poorest of the poor for whom natural disasters, strife and abject poverty prevent an escape from hunger and access to development opportunities. <br />
