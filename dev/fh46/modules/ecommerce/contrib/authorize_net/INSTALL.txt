Name: authorize_net module
Author: Matt Westgate <drupal at asitis dot org>
********************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

1. Place the entire authorize_net directory into your Drupal
   modules/ecommerce/ directory.

2. Load the database definition file (authorize_net.mysql) using the
   tool of your choice (e.g. phpmyadmin). For mysql and command line
   access use:

     mysql -u user -p drupal < authorize_net.mysql

   Replace 'user' with the MySQL username, and 'drupal' with the
   database being used.

3. Enable this module by navigating to:

     administer > modules

4. Configure this module by navigating to:

     administer > settings > authorize_net

5. Modify your includes/conf.php file to allow 'https' traffic.
   Underneath the $base_url line, add the following:

#
# Base URL:
#
#   The URL of your website's main page.  It is not allowed to have
#   a trailing slash; Drupal will add it for you.
#
$base_url = "http://www.example.com";

if ($_SERVER['HTTPS']) {
  $base_url = str_replace('http://', 'https://', $base_url);
}

6. You may need to create symlinks from you ssl directory to the
   drupal files files located in the public_html section. Here is
   what I did:

%cd ~/public_ssl/
%ln -s ~/public_html/index.php index.php
%ln -s ~/public_html/includes/ includes
%ln -s ~/public_html/modules/ modules
%ln -s ~/public_html/files/ files
%ln -s ~/public_html/misc/ misc
%ln -s ~/public_html/themes/ themes
%ln -s ~/public_html/.htaccess .htacess
%ln -s ~/public_html/xmlrpc.php xmlrpc.php
%cp ~/public_html/.htaccess .htaccess

7. You should now be able to navigate your Drupal site by going to
   either: http://www.example.com or https://www.example.com
