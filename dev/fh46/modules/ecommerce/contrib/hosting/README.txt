Drupal: 4.6
Dependencies:
  Product.module
********************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:

This module was created to scratch a itch. Since my hosting runs
drupal, I decided to check out and implement the ecommerce
package. Since none of the current product types suited my need I
created my own hosting package type.

Hack all you want, give me credit if you make something better of it.
