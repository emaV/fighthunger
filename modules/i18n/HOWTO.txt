HOWTO.txt
==========
This is a compilation of questions and answers about how to get specific features working with Drupal and i18n and also some general questions about the module.
 
+ How to patch the Drupal core with i18n patches
------------------------------------------------
   For a UNIX based server environment:
   - from the command line change into the "includes" directory
   - type patch -p0 -u < ../modules/i18n/patches/i18n_includes.patch
   - change directory to the modules directory
   - type patch -p0 -u < ./i18n/patches/i18n_taxonomy_module.patch
See http://drupal.org/diffandpatch for more info

+ How to get a different front page for each language
-----------------------------------------------------
  1. In administer > settings > i18n, set "Front page" to "Language dependent"
  2. In administer > settings, check the value of "Default front page". We'll assume "node" as it is the default
  3. Using the path module, create as many url aliases as different languages you have, pointing to the right front pages. I.e.
    en/node --> node/1 (english front page)
    es/node --> node/2 (spanish front page)
    ja/node --> node/3 ....
  4. Done, go to the site front page and switch languages

+ How can I get traslated terms working?
----------------------------------------
  To use the term translation feature:
  - Create a vocabulary WITHOUT language
  - Add to that vocabulary terms with different languages
  - Go to the translation tab in categories administration and define translations between the terms of one vocabulary
  Example:
  - Create the vocabulary 'Colors' without language
  - Create the following terms with their language:
    - Red [English]
    - Rojo [Spanish]
  - Go to the 'translations' tab and click on 'new translation' for the 'Colors' vocabulary
    - Select 'Red' for English
    - Select 'Rojo' for Spanish
    - Submit translation
    
+ Is there any documentation online?
------------------------------------
  Kind of, I try to put together some writings about this module, but it is more about the design and implementation than a user manual.
