Introduction:

This is an example of how to create a pdf invoice for displaying and
printing of invoices by customers. You are only restricted by what the
pdf-php class will allow you to do, so you can draw lines, and include
images to build a branded invoice that will make your E-Commerce site a lot
more professional.

Requirements:

You need the pdf-php class from http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf

Instructions:

Append the supplied template.php to your current themes template.php, of
copy the current one to you theme's directory.

Unpack the pdf-php tar into a directory called pdf in your themes directory.

Now when you look at an invoice it pop up with a download so you can view it
in a pdf viewer.
