INSTALLATION:

To use this module and process credit card transactions with E-Xact
you will need a merchant account from your bank and an account with
E-Xact Transactions.  Please go to http://www.e-xact.com for more
details

INSTALLING SOAP

This module uses the PEAR SOAP library to submit transactions to the
payment gateway. You must have PEAR SOAP installed.

http://pear.php.net/package/SOAP/

If when submitting transactions you get the following error:

*************
warning: exact_process(SOAP/Client.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in exact.module on line 217.
warning: exact_process(): Failed opening 'error' for inclusion (include_path='.:') in exact.module on line 217.

Fatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: soap_wsdl in exact.module on line 218
*************

Then you have the wrong path to your SOAP library or it isn't installed. If you
need to install PEAR, go here:

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php
http://builder.com.com/5100-6371-5163311.html

And if you need to install SOAP, go here:
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/07/03/php_amazon_soap.html
(you may need to run 'pear install SOAP-beta')


1. Place the entire exact directory into your Drupal
   modules/ecommerce/ directory.

2. Load the database definition file (exact.mysql) using the
   tool of your choice (e.g. phpmyadmin). For mysql and command line
   access use:

     mysql -u user -p drupal < exact.mysql

   Replace 'user' with the MySQL username, and 'drupal' with the
   database being used.

3. Enable this module by navigating to:

     administer > modules

4. Configure this module by navigating to:

     administer > settings > exact

5. You site must have SSL enabled in order to process payments. Open
   your sites/*/setting.php file and below the $base_url line add the
   following:

if ($_SERVER['HTTPS']) {
  $base_url = str_replace('http://', 'https://', $base_url);
}

6. You may need to create symlinks from you ssl directory to the
   drupal files files located in the public_html section. Here's
   what I did:

%cd ~/public_ssl/
%ln -s ~/public_html/index.php index.php
%ln -s ~/public_html/includes/ includes
%ln -s ~/public_html/modules/ modules
%ln -s ~/public_html/sites/ sites
%ln -s ~/public_html/files/ files
%ln -s ~/public_html/misc/ misc
%ln -s ~/public_html/themes/ themes
%ln -s ~/public_html/xmlrpc.php xmlrpc.php
%cp ~/public_html/.htaccess .htaccess

7. You should now be able to navigate your Drupal site by going to
   either: http://www.example.com or https://www.example.com


During a transaction, if after you click 'Place your order' you get the
following error:

'Unable to retrieve WSDL https://secure2.e-xact.com/vpos/process/vpos.asmx?wsdl'

Try using the local copy of the WSDL file. Go to:

   administer > settings > exact_process

and enter 'modules/ecommerce/contrib/exact/e-xact.wsdl' as the WSDL URL.
